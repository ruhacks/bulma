# [Bulma](https://bulma.io)

Bulma is a **modern CSS framework** based on [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes).

This fork has been modified to include RU Hacks specific changes such as:
- color scheme
- fonts
- etc. (more to come?)

## Quick install

Download the `bulma.css` file in the `css` directory.

## CSS only

Bulma is a **CSS** framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file: [bulma.css](https://github.com/ruhacks/bulma/blob/master/css/bulma.css)

There is **no** JavaScript included. People generally want to use their own JS implementation (and usually already have one). Bulma can be considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of the logic.

## Browser Support

Bulma uses [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make (most) Flexbox features compatible with earlier browser versions. According to [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox), Bulma is compatible with **recent** versions of:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari

Internet Explorer (10+) is only partially supported.
